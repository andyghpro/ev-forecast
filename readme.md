# Traffic forecast

The aim for this project is to forecast the UK daily traffic for the next 10 years. Source data is collected from Road traffic statistics: https://roadtraffic.dft.gov.uk/downloads.
The CSV file contains data for number of vehicles that travel past the count point (in both directions) on an average day of the year. We would first conduct EDA on the dataset breakdown in different granularity.
Then a prophet model will be used to forecast the traffic data
